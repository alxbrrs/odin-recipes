         <h1>Nachos</h1>
         <img src="../images/machos2.jpg" alt="nachos">

         <h2>Description</h2>
         <p>Nachos are great. I love nachos. One of the greatest things about nachos is that although there probably <em>is</em> a wrong way to make them,
            if you decide you don't care what other people think you can do whatever you think.</p>
        <p>For example, I once had a flatmate from france who really liked cooking and tried to tell me that chucking some cheese on top of a plate of tortilla
            chips and throwing it in the microwave didn't count as cooking. He can piss off, I was hungover and it was declicious.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Tortilla chips - as many as you want depending on how hungry you are/if you're being forced to share. Just use the whole bag, I won't tell.</li>
            <li>Cheese (lots), grated- I use cheddar, but I guess you can do what you want here, as long as it's something that will melt. Gouda maybe? See what you've got lurking in your fridge.</li>
            <li>Optional other stuff and toppings
                <ul>
                    <li>Spring onions ("scallions")/red onion, sliced or diced, whatever you want really (I like onions, ok?)</li>
                    <li>Jalapeno, sliced. I know the n should have a tilde over it, but my German keyboard doesn't want to do that right now.</li>
                    <li>Coriander ("cilantro"), because it's delicious </li>
                    <li><a href="./guac.html">Guacamole</a></li>
                    <li>Salsa, or <a href="./pico-de-gallo.html">pico de gallo</a></li>
                    <li>Sour cream</li>
                    <li>Chili con carne, but you'll have to find a recipe for that somewhere else</li>
                    <li>Anything else you can think of or find that sounds good. I don't know what's in your fridge.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <p>There's more than one way to do this, depending on how fancy you're feeling.</p>

        <h3>The super lazy way</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Put tortilla chips into a microwave safe bowl.</li>
            <li>Add cheese - mix some in so you don't end up disappointed when you've eaten the top layer and then you have to eat the rest all dry and cheeseless.</li>
            <li>Put it in the microwave. Honestly, I have no idea how long or what setting - try like, 30 seconds on full power and see what it looks like from there.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>The slightly fancier way</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to, idk, 180 degrees? Celsius, you Americans are on your own there.</li>
            <li>Put the nachos into an oven proof dish and add the cheese - again, maybe mix some in so there's no sad cheeseless bits underneath?</li>
            <li>Add any toppings you think should be hot. Personally I'd add them all after it has been in the oven, though.</li>
            <li>Sling it in the oven for a bit. Again, I don't know how long, just keep an eye on it and take it out when the cheese looks all melty and delicious.</li>
            <li>Remove from oven, add toppings, and eat before anyone notices you have nachos and asks you to share.</li>
        </ol>
