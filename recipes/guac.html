        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>When I was a young boy, my father took me into the city to eat some guacamole. That's how recipes start these days, right?</p>
        <p>Delicious creamy avocado-ness, goes great with nachos, in burritos or fajitas, on toast, 
            or you can just stuff your face into the bowl and eat it like an animal because guacamole is delicious.</p>
        <p>It doesn't keep well in the fridge for very long, though, so make sure to eat it all before it goes all brown and nasty.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Two avocados - make sure you get nice ones that are just right, not ones that are rock solid or disgusting mush.</li>
            <li>One red onion, diced</li>
            <li>A medium-ish tomato, diced</li>
            <li>Coriander, chopped - unless you're one of <em>those</em> people that hates coriander. AKA "cilantro", for the Americans in the room</li>
            <li>A bit of lime juice - preferably fresh but if you're like me you'll definitely forget to buy a lime so from a bottle works too</li>
            <li>Chili, finely diced - optional, jalapeno is nice, but the ones around here aren't very hot so just use whatever. Taste test for spice level if you're feeling brave</li>
            <li>Chili powder to taste - also optional, in case you got a chili that wasn't hot enough</li>
            <li>A clove of garlic, minced - also also optional, I haven't added it recently but I've definitely seen my boyfriend add it before</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste - probably way more than will seem sensible or healthy at first but it does make a big difference</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Remove avocado from skin, somehow. I always make a mess so I can't really help you here, but it doesn't really matter as long as all the good bits of the avocado end up in a big bowl</li>
            <li>Add the onion, tomato, lime, and chili and garlic if you're using them, to the bowl with the avocado. Mash with a fork or a potato masher.</li>
            <li>Once things are looking a bit smoother, add the coriander and mix it in. Keep mashing any chunks of avocado you find, unless you like it that way.</li>
            <li>Add salt, pepper and chili powder if you're using it, and mix them in. Time for a taste test!</li>
            <li>Add more seasoning (and possibly more lime juice) until you're happy with it.</li>
            <li>Congrats, you've got guac!</li>
        </ol>
