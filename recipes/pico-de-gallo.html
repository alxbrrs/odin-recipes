        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>I don't have much to say about this but it is lovely and fresh and has onions in it which by now I'm sure you've noticed I'm a fan of.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>White onion, finely chopped. Or use a red one. It's probably not very authentic, but it's still delicious.</li>
            <li>Jalapenos, also finely chopped - you might want to take out the seeds and the weird white bits on the inside first.</li>
            <li>Lime juice, fresh - I guess start with one lime and if it doesn't look like enough do more?</li>
            <li>Salt, I googled it and the internet says start with 3/4tsp and then more to taste, so do that I guess.</li>
            <li>Lots of tomatoes, chopped fairly small but not as small as the onions.</li>
            <li>Lots of coriander, also chopped.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Put the onion, jalapeno, lime juice and salt into a bowl, mix it together and let it sit for a bit. 5 mins is probably long enough, I dunno.</li>
            <li>Add the tomatoes and coriander, and mix again.</li>
            <li>Give it a taste, and add more salt if you think it needs it.</li>
            <li>Apparently it's better if you let it "marinate" for a bit, but I'm impatient and don't like waiting. You can do what you want, I'm not the salsa police.</li>
        </ol>
